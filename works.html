                <p>Save the Whales was designed to preserve and protect the ocean and its inhabitants. 
    
                    <br>Our organization isnâ€™t providing insights on what we are doing to help or how we are making an impact, which makes interacting with our website confusing for our users. 
                    
                    <br>This is detracting from our credibility keeping people from learning how to help on our website.</p>

                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>We found out that outdated design on the current website distracts the user from the main goal of the website. 
 
                 <br> In order to navigate the target users to land in a successful area, we decided to focus on simplifying the design by re-organizing hierarchy and updating outdate UI elements. 
                 
                 <br> After the survey, we thought that it is important to conduct an interview to have a better insight for our user Olivia. 
                 
                 <br> From those we gained some key insights that people generally had a positive attitude toward our value  and they were willing to donate when the organization had a clear transparency and purpose.
